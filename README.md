Welcome to my github</br>
Here you can find random bits and bobs that I have probably just made for fun since im not a professional programmer.
</br> Or maybe even something that might be slightly usefull, but I highly doubt that.

</p>

However you may find a few small bits that have been made for other people, at the minute its probably going to be discord bots.</br>
Oh and I might also make a FNF mod too.

### I am currently learning:
+ Java &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(this is my main language because I want to make minecraft mods, and clients.)*
+ Python &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(im learning this one at school.)*

  In the future expect to see some usefull minecraft mods. And maybe even texture packs as well.
